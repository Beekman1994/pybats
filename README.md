# PyBATS
Bayesian time series modeling and forecasting

## Installation
PyBATS is in development, and is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/lavinei/pybats).. You can download and install from there:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lavinei/pybats.git pybats
$ cd pybats
$ sudo python setup.py install
```


## Quick Start
This provides the most basic example of Bayesian time series analysis using pybats. The package includes a public dataset of the sales of a dietary weight control product. These are integer valued counts, which we model with a Poisson Dynamic Generalized Linear Model (DGLM).

Let's take a quick look at the first terms in the dataset:
```
