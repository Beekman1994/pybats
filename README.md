# PyBATS
Bayesian time series modeling and forecasting

## Installation
PyBATS is available on PyPI for Python 3, and can be easily installed:

```
pip install pybats
```

The code (and most up-to-date version) are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lavinei/pybats).

## Quick Start
This provides the most basic example of Bayesian time series analysis using pybats. The package includes a data set counting flows of visitors between pages on a website. These are integer valued counts, which we model with a Poisson Dynamic Generalized Linear Model (DGLM).

Let's take a quick look at the first terms in the dataset:
